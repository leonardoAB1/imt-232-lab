## Course Introduction

Embedded systems are everywhere. During the first part of this course, Embedded Systems I, we studied microprocessor (MPU) and microcontroller (MCU) based embedded systems. 

Now, in Embedded Systems II, we expand on this knowledge by adding the use of real-time operating systems (RTOS) for embedded systems. These are necessary for applications that require a fast response, such as automobile airbags, motor control systems, etc. 

It should be emphasized that the use of an RTOS is not always necessary, as it depends on the application and can sometimes be accomplished through bare-metal programming or the use of CMSIS libraries. 

After studying the use of RTOS in MCUs, we will proceed to the study of other types of reconfigurable integrated systems, such as FPGAs and SoC-FPGAs. 

The course is divided into the following topics:

- Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS), DMA, Intro to CAN
- Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) and System on Chip (SoC)

## Contents

We plan to cover the following topics in-depth:

- RTOS (FreeRTOS)
- Energy and Power
- DMA and CAN
- FPGA
- SoC-FPGA

## Tools

The following tools will be used to complete the labs and exercises:

- MCU
- FPGA
- Keil uvision 5 or STM32CUBE
- LabView
